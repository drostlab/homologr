\title{Translate CDS file to Amino Acids file}
\usage{
transl_cds_to_aa(dt, delete_corrupt_cds = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{a \code{data.table} object storing cds sequences in a column named \code{seqs}.}

\item{delete_corrupt_cds}{a logical value indicating whether sequences with corrupt base triplets should be removed from the input \code{file}. This is the case when the length of coding sequences cannot be divided by 3 and thus the coding sequence contains at least one corrupt base triplet.}
}
\description{
This function takes a \code{data.table} object as input and
translates the cds sequences stored as \code{seqs} column into the corresponding amino acid
sequence.
